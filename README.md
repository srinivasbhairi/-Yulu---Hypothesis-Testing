üö≤ Yulu Electric Cycle Demand Analysis

üìå Project Overview

Yulu is India‚Äôs leading micro-mobility service provider, offering sustainable electric cycle solutions for daily commuting. Recently, Yulu has faced a dip in revenues and contracted a consulting company to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared electric cycles.

This project focuses on analyzing the Yulu dataset (yulu_data.csv) to identify the significant variables affecting demand, evaluate their relationships, and perform statistical hypothesis testing to derive insights.

üéØ Objectives

Identify significant variables in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles.

Understand how well these variables explain variations in demand.

Perform hypothesis testing to validate the relationships between demand and key factors.


üîç Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data inspection: structure, missing values, summary statistics

Univariate analysis: histograms, boxplots, barplots

Bivariate analysis: scatterplots, heatmaps, group comparisons

2. Hypothesis Testing

2-Sample T-Test

Test whether working days affect the number of cycles rented

H0: No difference in rentals between working and non-working days

H1: Rentals differ between working and non-working days

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Compare rentals across seasons

Compare rentals across different weather conditions

Chi-Square Test of Independence

Test if weather is dependent on season

3. Statistical Assumptions

Normality check (Histogram, Q-Q Plot, Shapiro-Wilk Test)

Homogeneity of variance check (Levene‚Äôs Test)

Proceed with tests and report assumptions validity
### üìå **Business Recommendations for Yulu Rentals**

#### 1. **Integrate Seasonal Weather Forecasting**

* Plan operations using **season-specific weather patterns**.
* Allocate **bike inventory, servicing, and support staff** based on expected weather trends.

#### 2. **Design Weather-Sensitive Campaigns**

* Offer **rain or winter ride incentives** (discounts, loyalty points).
* Run **summer campaigns** promoting leisure rides in good weather.

#### 3. **Predictive Modeling**

* Enhance rental demand models by including **weather-season interaction** as a feature.
* Improves **forecasting accuracy** for resource allocation, pricing, and fleet balancing.

#### 4. **User Safety & Communication**

* Send **weather-based alerts** or safety tips, especially during seasons known for poor conditions (e.g., snow in winter).
* Highlight **weather-based insurance or coverage** for users during high-risk periods.

#### 5. **Dynamic Pricing**

* Implement **seasonal pricing** that adapts to both **weather severity and frequency**.

  * For example: Increase rates on clear days in summer; decrease during rainy fall days to boost usage.

#### 6. **Operational Buffering**

* Increase **maintenance checks** before weather-intensive seasons (like winter).
* Deploy **weather protection infrastructure** (e.g., bike covers, station shelters) in seasons with high rainfall or snow.
